  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <p>My name is Sierra Rhodes. I am currently a student at Portland State University majoring in Computer Science. Originally, I wanted to pursue a degree in nursing, but I realized it did not encompass all that I would want out of a fulfilling career. I decided to take a coding bootcamp course to help break into the tech field.</p>

  <p> I have many hobbies and interests but here are some that stand out among the rest:
    <ul>
      <li>Reading</li>
      <li>Writing</li>
      <li>Drawing</li>
      <li>Videogames</li>
    </ul>
